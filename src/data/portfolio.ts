    content: `Fine-tuning large language models has become one of the most impactful techniques in modern NLP. In this post, I'll walk through the practical steps of adapting a pre-trained LLM to your specific domain.\n\n## Why Fine-Tune?\n\nWhile pre-trained models like GPT-4 and Llama are incredibly capable, they often lack domain-specific knowledge. Fine-tuning bridges this gap efficiently.\n\n## Approaches\n\n### LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)\nLoRA freezes the pre-trained weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices. This dramatically reduces the number of trainable parameters.\n\n### QLoRA\nCombines quantization with LoRA for even more memory-efficient training. You can fine-tune a 65B parameter model on a single GPU.\n\n## Best Practices\n1. Start with a high-quality, curated dataset\n2. Use appropriate learning rates (1e-4 to 5e-5)\n3. Monitor for overfitting with validation metrics\n4. Evaluate on held-out test sets with domain-specific metrics`,

    content: `Reproducibility is one of the biggest challenges in machine learning. In this post, I share my approach to building robust ML pipelines using MLflow.\n\n## The Problem\n\nMost ML projects start as Jupyter notebooks that quickly become unmaintainable. Without proper tracking, it's impossible to reproduce results.\n\n## MLflow Components\n\n### Tracking\nLog parameters, metrics, and artifacts for every experiment run.\n\n### Projects\nPackage your code in a reproducible format with conda environments.\n\n### Model Registry\nVersion and stage your models (Staging → Production) with approval workflows.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- Track everything from day one\n- Use consistent naming conventions\n- Automate your pipeline with CI/CD`,

    content: `Computer vision has seen remarkable progress in 2024. Let's explore the key trends shaping the field.\n\n## Foundation Models\n\nModels like SAM (Segment Anything) and DINOv2 have changed how we approach CV tasks. Instead of training from scratch, we can now leverage these foundation models.\n\n## Edge Deployment\n\nWith optimized architectures like EfficientNet and MobileNet, deploying CV models on edge devices is more practical than ever.\n\n## Multimodal Learning\n\nThe convergence of vision and language (CLIP, GPT-4V) is opening new possibilities for understanding visual content.\n\n## What's Next?\n- Video understanding at scale\n- 3D scene reconstruction\n- Embodied AI and robotics`,

    content: `After years of building ML systems, I've learned one lesson that stands above all others: data quality matters more than model complexity.\n\n## The 80/20 Rule of ML\n\n80% of your model's performance comes from your data. The remaining 20% comes from architecture and hyperparameter choices.\n\n## Practical Steps\n\n### 1. Data Profiling\nUnderstand your data distributions, missing values, and outliers before training.\n\n### 2. Labeling Quality\nInvest in clear labeling guidelines and inter-annotator agreement metrics.\n\n### 3. Data Augmentation\nUse smart augmentation strategies that reflect real-world variation.\n\n## Conclusion\nBefore reaching for the latest transformer architecture, invest in understanding and cleaning your data. The ROI is almost always higher.`,
